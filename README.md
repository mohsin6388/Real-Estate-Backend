# Backend — Phase 1: Skeleton (Models + Auth/RBAC)

## ⚡ Migration notice: local WhatsApp (Baileys/QR) removed → Unipile + Google Calendar added

Everything below this box is the original phase-by-phase history and is kept for context, but
**the WhatsApp integration it describes (Baileys, QR-code pairing, `WA_*` env vars,
`/whatsapp/connect|status|disconnect`, per-broker sockets) has been removed.** WhatsApp now goes
through **Unipile's cloud API** instead — no local session, no QR scanning, nothing to keep alive.

**What changed:**
- `src/services/whatsapp/sessionManager.js`, `mongoAuthState.js`, `sendQueue.js`, and the
  `WhatsAppSession`/`WhatsAppAuthState` models are gone.
- New `src/services/whatsapp/unipileClient.js` — sends messages via Unipile's
  `POST /api/v1/chats` (opening message / new chat) and `POST /api/v1/chats/{chat_id}/messages`
  (replies in an existing chat).
- New `POST /api/whatsapp/webhook` route (public, no auth) — register this URL in your Unipile
  dashboard under Webhooks → New message. Every inbound WhatsApp message lands here, gets matched
  to a `Lead` by phone number, and is handed to the same `conversationEngine.handleInbound()` the
  AI always used — the AI logic itself didn't change, only how messages get in and out.
- `Conversation.unipileChatId` (new field) tracks each lead's chat id so replies go into the
  existing thread instead of starting a new chat every time.
- `GET /api/whatsapp/status` now just reports whether `UNIPILE_API_KEY`/`UNIPILE_ACCOUNT_ID` are
  configured — there's no "QR pending" state anymore, Unipile handles the actual WhatsApp
  connection on their side (you pair the number once in the Unipile dashboard).
- **Google Calendar booking added**: when the AI detects the buyer has agreed to a site visit, it
  still creates a `Meeting` record as before, and now also books a real event on Google Calendar
  via `src/services/calendar/googleCalendarService.js` (service-account auth — no OAuth flow to
  build). The event id/link are stored on the `Meeting` (`googleEventId`, `googleEventLink`), and
  rescheduling/cancelling a meeting through `PATCH /api/meetings/:id` keeps the calendar event in
  sync automatically.

**Required `.env` additions** (see `.env` in this project, already filled in with placeholders):
```
UNIPILE_API_KEY=...
UNIPILE_DSN=https://api51.unipile.com:18127
UNIPILE_ACCOUNT_ID=...
UNIPILE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...            # optional but recommended

GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL=...
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY=...
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID=...                # or "primary"
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_TIMEZONE=Asia/Kolkata
```

**Google Calendar setup (one-time):** create a Service Account in Google Cloud Console → enable
the Calendar API → generate a JSON key → put its `client_email`/`private_key` into the env vars
above → open the target calendar's settings → "Share with specific people" → add the service
account's email with "Make changes to events" permission.

**Unipile webhook setup (one-time):** in the Unipile dashboard, add a webhook with source
`messaging` pointing at `https://your-domain.com/api/whatsapp/webhook?secret=<UNIPILE_WEBHOOK_SECRET>`.

---

## What's in this phase
- All 13 Mongoose models from the architecture doc (`src/models/`)
- Full JWT auth: register, login, refresh (rotating, with reuse detection),
  logout, forgot-password, reset-password, `/auth/me`
- RBAC middleware (`roleGuard`) ready to use on future routes
- Security stack: Helmet, CORS w/ credentials, mongo-sanitize, rate limiting
  (global + stricter on auth routes), centralized error handler, Winston logging
- Graceful shutdown, health check endpoint

## Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # edit values, especially JWT secrets and MONGO_URI
npm run dev             # requires MongoDB running locally, or point MONGO_URI at Atlas
npm run seed:admin      # optional: creates the first admin user
```

## Try it
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test Broker","email":"broker@test.com","password":"Password1","role":"broker"}'
```
The response includes an `accessToken`; the refresh token is set as an httpOnly cookie automatically.

## Not in this phase yet
Leads/Properties CRUD, WhatsApp (Baileys), AI engine (Gemini), Conversations,
Meetings, Follow-ups, Analytics, Settings routes, and the entire frontend.
These come in the phases that follow — same approach (real, runnable code, not stubs).

---

## Phase 2: Leads Module (added)

New in this phase:
- `POST /api/leads/import/preview` — upload a CSV (`multipart/form-data`, field `file`), get back every
  row tagged `valid` / `invalid` / `duplicate` with reasons. Nothing is saved yet.
  - Recognizes flexible headers: Name, Phone/Mobile, Email, City, Location, Budget (or Budget Min/Max —
    parses formats like `50L`, `1.2 Cr`, `50L-70L`), Occupation, Age, Lead Source, Notes, Requirements.
  - Duplicate check against your existing leads (by phone) AND within the file itself.
- `POST /api/leads/import/confirm` — send back the rows you want to actually import
  (`{ "rows": [...] }`). Bulk-inserts with `insertMany({ordered:false})` so one bad row
  never blocks the rest; each imported lead gets an empty `Conversation` shell ready for
  the WhatsApp/AI phase.
- `GET /api/leads` — pagination, text search, filter by `status`/`city`/`tag`, sortable.
- `POST /api/leads` / `GET /api/leads/:id` / `PATCH /api/leads/:id` / `DELETE /api/leads/:id`
- `POST /api/leads/bulk-delete` — `{ "ids": [...] }`
- `POST /api/leads/:id/tags` — `{ "add": [...], "remove": [...] }`
- `GET /api/leads/export` — downloads the current filtered view as CSV

All lead routes require `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` and role `broker` or `admin`.
Every route is scoped to `req.user.id` as `ownerId` — a broker can never see or touch another
broker's leads; admins can pass `?ownerId=<brokerId>` to inspect a specific broker's pipeline.

### Try it
```bash
# 1. Register/login as a broker to get an accessToken (see Phase 1 section above)

# 2. Preview a CSV import
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/leads/import/preview \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>" \
  -F "file=@leads.csv"

# 3. Confirm import (send back the "rows" array from the preview response,
#    typically filtered to status === 'valid')
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/leads/import/confirm \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"rows":[{"name":"Rahul Sharma","phone":"9876543210","budgetMin":5000000,"budgetMax":7000000}]}'
```

### Verified in this session (no live MongoDB in this sandbox, so):
- All files pass `node --check` (syntax) and the full app boots with all routes mounted (`require` graph verified).
- CSV parsing/validation logic tested directly with sample data — budget-range parsing
  (`50L-70L`, `1.2 Cr`), header aliasing, and row validation all confirmed working.
- CRUD/import DB logic (Mongoose queries, dedup, insertMany) is standard, well-trodden
  Mongoose patterns — but **run it against a real MongoDB before deploying** to catch anything
  environment-specific.

---

## Phase 3: Properties Module (added)

New in this phase:
- `POST /api/properties/import/preview` — upload a CSV (`multipart/form-data`, field `file`).
  Recognizes: Project Name, Builder Name, Property Type, BHK, Location, City, Budget (or
  Budget Min/Max — same `50L` / `1.2 Cr` / `50L-95L` parsing as leads), Size, Amenities
  (comma or pipe separated), Parking (Yes/No), RERA Number, Nearby Metro/School/Hospital,
  Google Maps Link, Description, Images (comma/pipe-separated URLs).
  - Soft-duplicate detection on `(projectName + location)` — informational, since builders
    legitimately re-list phases/towers of the same project; doesn't block import.
- `POST /api/properties/import/confirm` — `{ "rows": [...] }`, bulk-inserts.
- `GET /api/properties` — pagination, text search, filter by city/type/BHK/budget range
  (budget filter is an **overlap** match: a property qualifies if its range intersects
  the requested min/max at all, not an exact-contains match).
- `POST /api/properties` / `GET /api/properties/:id` / `PATCH /api/properties/:id` / `DELETE /api/properties/:id`
- `POST /api/properties/bulk-delete`, `GET /api/properties/export`

### Access model (different from Leads)
- **Builder / Admin**: full CRUD, scoped to their own inventory (admin can pass `?ownerId=`).
- **Broker**: **read-only**, and only sees `isActive: true` listings — brokers browse
  inventory to match against their leads but never edit another org's properties.
  This is intentional groundwork for the Phase 5 AI property-matching engine.

### Verified in this session
- Full syntax check + app boot (all requires resolve).
- **Route-ordering bug caught and fixed during testing**: `/export` and `/:id` both being
  GET routes meant `/export` could be swallowed by `/:id` (Express matches `:id="export"`)
  if declared in the wrong order. Verified the fix with a stubbed-auth request that reached
  `Property.find()` (the export path) rather than a CastError on `'export'` as an ObjectId.
- CSV parsing tested directly: budget ranges, pipe/comma-separated amenities, Yes/No →
  boolean parsing, and URL validation for the Maps link all confirmed correct.
- No live MongoDB in this sandbox — CRUD/import Mongoose logic follows the same
  well-trodden patterns as the Leads module, but **test against a real MongoDB before deploying.**

---

## Phase 4: WhatsApp Connection — Baileys (added)

New in this phase:
- `POST /api/whatsapp/connect` — starts a Baileys connection for the logged-in broker.
  Returns immediately; the QR code arrives over **Socket.IO** (`whatsapp:qr` event) within
  a few seconds. Poll `GET /api/whatsapp/status` if you'd rather not use sockets.
- `GET /api/whatsapp/status` — `{ status, qrCode, phoneNumber, lastConnectedAt }`.
  `status` is one of `not_connected | pending_qr | connected | disconnected | logged_out`.
- `POST /api/whatsapp/disconnect` — logs out and clears the session (requires a fresh QR scan next time).
- `POST /api/whatsapp/send-test` — `{ phone, text }`, a manual dev utility to confirm a
  connected session can actually send (the real conversation flow comes in Phase 5/6).

### Socket.IO
Connect with `io(API_URL, { auth: { token: accessToken } })`. Each socket joins a room
scoped to the logged-in user, so `whatsapp:qr` / `whatsapp:status` / `conversation:newMessage`
events only ever reach that broker's own connected clients.

### How session isolation & persistence work
- **Per-broker everything**: each broker's Baileys socket, auth credentials, and signal
  keys are fully independent, keyed by `brokerId`. Nothing is ever shared or mixed between brokers.
- **MongoDB-backed auth state** (`src/services/whatsapp/mongoAuthState.js`), not the default
  filesystem-based `useMultiFileAuthState`. This was a deliberate choice over the simpler
  disk-based approach: your spec asks for "reconnect automatically after restart" and a
  scalable, production-ready system — filesystem sessions don't survive across container
  restarts on most cloud hosts (Render, Railway, ECS, etc.) or across multiple instances,
  Mongo does.
- **Auto-reconnect**: `server.js` calls `sessionManager.reconnectAll()` on boot, which
  reconnects every broker session that wasn't explicitly logged out — no manual re-scan needed
  after a deploy/restart. Non-logout disconnects (network blips, etc.) also auto-retry with
  exponential backoff while the server is running.
- **Send throttling**: each broker gets its own outbound queue with a randomized 3–12s delay
  between messages and a configurable daily cap (`WA_DAILY_MSG_CAP`, default 800) — reduces
  the chance of WhatsApp flagging the number for bot-like behavior. Tune via `.env`.
- **Inbound messages**: `src/services/whatsapp/inboundHandler.js` matches the sender's phone
  to a `Lead` for that broker, dedupes by WhatsApp message ID, persists to `Message`/`Conversation`,
  and pushes a live update over Socket.IO. This is explicitly the hook point Phase 5 (Gemini AI
  engine) plugs into — the comment `// ---- Phase 5 hook point ----` marks exactly where.

### ⚠️ Honest limitation of this sandbox
This environment's network is locked to package registries only (npm, GitHub, PyPI) — it
cannot reach WhatsApp's servers. That means **I could not test an actual live QR scan or
message exchange here**. What I *did* verify:
- All files pass `node --check` and the full app + Socket.IO + session manager boot cleanly
  (every `require` resolves).
- Confirmed all Baileys exports this code relies on (`makeWASocket`, `useMultiFileAuthState`,
  `initAuthCreds`, `BufferJSON`, `DisconnectReason`, `proto`, etc.) actually exist in the
  installed package version — not assumed from memory.
- **Directly tested the Mongo auth-state adapter's Buffer round-tripping** (the part most
  likely to silently corrupt a session) with a stubbed in-memory store: wrote a signal key
  containing real `Buffer` values, read it back, confirmed byte-for-byte equality; confirmed
  credentials persist across a simulated reload; confirmed key deletion on `set(null)` works.
- Confirmed routes are wired and RBAC-guarded (broker-only) via live HTTP requests.

**Before going live**: connect a real WhatsApp number via `npm run dev` + the `/connect`
endpoint on a machine with real internet access, and watch the first QR scan through to a
few real message round-trips. Baileys itself is a mature, widely-used library — the risk
here is entirely in the surrounding wiring (which is now tested), not in Baileys' own protocol handling.

## Phase 5: AI Conversation Engine (Gemini) + Property Matching + Site Visits + Lead Scoring/Follow-ups

This phase plugs directly into the hook point left in Phase 4 (`inboundHandler.js`). It's one
cohesive module because, per the spec, property matching and site-visit scheduling are actions
the AI *takes* mid-conversation, not separate features — same for lead scoring and follow-ups.

### New pieces
- **`src/services/ai/geminiClient.js`** — thin wrapper over Gemini's `generateContent` REST
  endpoint using Node's native `fetch` (no SDK dependency added). Supports forced structured
  JSON output via `responseSchema` (Gemini's native structured-output feature), which is used
  everywhere instead of asking the model to "please reply in JSON" and hoping — much more reliable.
- **`src/services/ai/promptBuilder.js`** — builds the sales-executive persona system prompt
  (tone rules: never sound like an AI, vary phrasing, handle jokes/off-topic/abuse naturally,
  ask 1-2 questions at a time) plus the JSON schema the reply call must return.
- **`src/services/ai/conversationEngine.js`** — the orchestrator. For every inbound WhatsApp
  message: loads *only that lead's* message history (hard requirement from your spec — memory
  never mixes between leads), calls Gemini for a structured reply, sends it back through that
  broker's own throttled WhatsApp queue, extracts/merges buyer requirements turn-by-turn,
  triggers property matching once enough is known, and auto-creates a `Meeting` (Site Visit)
  the moment the buyer agrees to one.
- **`src/services/ai/propertyMatcher.js`** — deterministic (non-AI) scoring against the
  organization's `Property` collection: budget overlap is a hard filter (never recommends
  something out of budget), then ranks by BHK/location/amenity matches. Gemini explains the
  *why* in natural language; the matching itself is cheap, fast, and explainable.
- **`src/services/ai/leadAnalyzer.js`** — a second, separate Gemini call (lower temperature,
  since scoring should be consistent, not creative) that reads the full transcript and returns
  score/level/interest/closing-probability/summary plus a suggested next follow-up date+message.
  Fired async after each AI reply so the buyer isn't kept waiting on two model calls per message.
  Writes an append-only `LeadScore` history entry, updates `Lead.leadScore`/`status` (without
  ever overriding a broker's manual `closed`/`lost`/`site_visit` call), upserts the pending
  `FollowUp`, and raises a `hot_lead` Notification the moment a lead first crosses into "hot".
- **`src/services/settings/settingsService.js`** + **`src/utils/crypto.js`** — each
  org's Gemini API key is AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest (`Settings.geminiApiKeyEncrypted`,
  `select: false` so it never round-trips to the client) and falls back to the platform-wide
  `GEMINI_API_KEY` env var if an org hasn't set their own yet — the product works out of the box.
- **Conversations API** (`/api/conversations`) — list with the spec's exact filter set
  (unread/hot/warm/cold/site_visit/closed/lost + search), full thread view, manual reply,
  Take Over Chat / Resume AI, mark-read.
- **Site Visits API** (`/api/meetings`) — list/create/update/delete; updating status to
  `visited`/`not_visited`/`cancelled` nudges the linked Lead's status accordingly (again, never
  overriding a manually-closed/lost lead).
- **Follow-ups API** (`/api/followups`) — the pending-follow-ups queue, sorted by due date.
- **Settings API** (`/api/settings`) — company profile, Gemini key, business hours, greeting
  message, plus one-tap `POST /api/settings/ai/pause` and `/ai/resume`.

### Design decisions worth knowing about
- **One call vs. two per message**: reply generation and lead scoring are deliberately separate
  Gemini calls. A single combined call would make the buyer wait longer for their reply while
  the model also reasons about scoring internals; splitting them keeps the chat responsive and
  lets scoring run on the full transcript (better signal) without blocking anything.
- **Requirements live on `Conversation.collectedRequirements`** (a new field added to that model
  this phase), not bolted onto `Lead`. Key fields (`city`, `location`, `budgetMin/Max`) are still
  mirrored back onto `Lead` on every turn so the existing Leads list/filter/CSV-export UI from
  Phase 2 keeps working unchanged.
- **AI failures fail silently to the buyer, loudly to the logs**: if Gemini errors or returns
  unparseable JSON, the buyer simply doesn't get a reply that turn (broker can always see it and
  reply manually from the Conversations page) rather than sending a broken/generic message.

### ⚠️ Honest limitation of this sandbox
This environment has no network access at all in this sandbox, so **I could not make a real
call to the Gemini API and watch an actual conversation happen**. What I *did* verify:
- Every new/modified file passes `node --check`.
- Every relative `require()` across the entire backend resolves to a real file (scripted check,
  not eyeballed) — no typo'd import paths.
- Cross-checked the Gemini structured-output request shape (`system_instruction`, `contents`,
  `generationConfig.responseMimeType` / `responseSchema`) against the documented API format.
- Traced the full data flow by hand: inbound message → `conversationEngine.handleInbound` →
  Gemini reply → `sessionManager.sendMessage`/`recordOutboundMessage` → `analyzeConversationAsync`
  → `LeadScore`/`FollowUp`/`Notification` writes — confirmed every model field referenced exists
  on the corresponding schema.

**Before going live**: set a real `GEMINI_API_KEY` (or add one per-org in Settings), connect a
broker's WhatsApp number, and send it a real test message end-to-end. Also sanity-check Gemini
API pricing/rate limits for your expected message volume — `GEMINI_MODEL` defaults to
`gemini-2.0-flash` for cost/latency, switch it in `.env` if you need a stronger model.

---

## Bugfix: Leads imported but no WhatsApp conversation ever started

**Root cause**: `handleInbound()` in the AI engine only ever *replied* to incoming customer
messages — nothing in the codebase ever sent the first, outbound message. So importing/creating
a lead created an empty `Conversation` shell and just... stopped there. Forever. Nobody spoke first.

**Fix** — three changes, all fire-and-forget so they never slow down the API response:

1. **`src/services/ai/conversationEngine.js`** — new `startConversation({ lead, conversation })`:
   sends the opening WhatsApp message (AI-personalized if a Gemini key is configured, falling back
   to `Settings.greetingMessage` otherwise). Idempotent — no-ops if the conversation already has
   any messages, isn't `ai_active`, AI is paused, or the broker's WhatsApp isn't connected yet.
2. **`src/controllers/leadController.js`** — both `createLead` and `confirmImport` now call
   `startConversation` right after creating each lead's `Conversation`, without `await`-blocking
   the response. Also fixed a latent bug where `confirmImport`'s `Conversation.insertMany(...).catch(() => {})`
   silently discarded ALL inserted conversation docs (not just the failed ones) whenever even one
   conversation already existed (e.g. re-importing a previously-deleted-then-restored lead) —
   now captures `err.insertedDocs` the same way the `Lead.insertMany` call above it already did.
3. **`src/services/whatsapp/sessionManager.js`** — new `catchUpPendingConversations(brokerId)` in
   `conversationEngine.js`, called whenever a broker's WhatsApp connects (fresh connect or
   reconnect). Finds any `ai_active` conversations with zero messages for that broker and starts
   them. This closes the loop regardless of ordering — leads imported *before* WhatsApp is
   connected get their opening message the moment the broker scans the QR, not never.

**Verified in this session** (no live Mongo/WhatsApp in this sandbox, so tested with stubbed
models/services): confirmed the opening message sends with the correct fallback text when no
Gemini key is configured; confirmed it's a true no-op (no send attempted, no crash) when WhatsApp
isn't connected; confirmed it won't double-send if the conversation already has a message; confirmed
`manual`-status conversations are skipped. All four tests pass — see chat history for the exact
stubbed test scripts if you want to rerun them.

**Note on Gemini's API**: `generateStructured` requires a non-empty `contents` array — there's no
such thing as "just a system prompt, no turns" in the Gemini API. Added `buildOpeningHistory()` to
`promptBuilder.js`, a synthetic priming turn used only for this first-message case (real replies
already had real history to send).

---

## Bugfix round 2: opening message silently not sending after a server restart

**Root cause**: `startConversation()`'s "is WhatsApp ready?" check was querying the *persisted*
`WhatsAppSession.status` field in MongoDB. That field is only trustworthy as long as the Node
process that set it is still running — after ANY server restart (crash, redeploy, or just
`nodemon` restarting because a file changed, which is very common while iterating in dev), the
DB still says `status: 'connected'` from before the restart for the few seconds it takes the
real Baileys socket to reconnect. If a lead got created/imported in that window, `startConversation`
saw the stale "connected" status, tried to send, and `sessionManager.sendMessage()` threw
`"WhatsApp is not connected for this broker"` (because the actual in-memory socket map was still
empty) — caught, logged, and the lead's first message was gone for good unless a full reconnect
happened to trigger `catchUpPendingConversations` again.

**Fix**:
1. `src/services/ai/conversationEngine.js` — `startConversation()` now checks
   `sessionManager.getSessionStatus(brokerId)` (the actual in-memory socket map — real, current
   truth) instead of the DB field. Verified with stub tests: sending only happens when the broker
   is truly live in-memory, and is correctly skipped when it isn't, regardless of what the DB says.
2. `src/controllers/whatsappController.js` — `GET /api/whatsapp/status` now also returns
   `liveConnected: boolean` alongside the existing `status` field. If you ever see
   `status: "connected"` but `liveConnected: false`, the server is mid-reconnect (normal for a few
   seconds after a restart) — wait a moment and it'll self-correct. If it stays mismatched, check
   the server logs for `[whatsapp]` lines for that broker id.

### If leads still aren't triggering a message after this fix, check in this order:
1. **Is WhatsApp actually connected right now?** Call `GET /api/whatsapp/status` — you need
   `status: "connected"` AND `liveConnected: true`. If `liveConnected` is `false`, wait a few
   seconds (server is reconnecting) or reconnect from the WhatsApp page.
2. **Check server console logs** — every skip/failure in `startConversation` logs a line starting
   with `[ai]`. That'll tell you exactly why: not connected yet, AI paused, auto-reply disabled,
   or a Gemini/send error with the actual error message.
3. **Settings** — `GET /api/settings` for that org: `aiPaused` must be `false` and
   `autoReplyEnabled` must be `true`. (A Gemini key is NOT required — it falls back to
   `greetingMessage` automatically if none is configured.)
4. **Timing**: if you uploaded leads *before* ever connecting WhatsApp for the first time, nothing
   sends until you connect — that's by design. The moment you do connect, `catchUpPendingConversations`
   sends all of their opening messages automatically. No manual retry needed.
